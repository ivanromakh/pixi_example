### PIXI gravity game ###

This is SPA project with bootsrap and pixi

Just run index.html to see result in brouser

## Model ##
There is all shapes and their methods like updating, generating, collision detectiong, type conversion and color randomization.

## ViewPage ##
This is for users clicking and page content changing.

## App ##
This is like controller. There is all logic.

## settings ##
here you can find global variables which dictated fules like GRAVITY_VALUE.

## Shapes ##
As you can known from the name, this is all shape types for my renderer.

## index.html ##
This is page to run this few buttons and input fields.

So try to load and run in brouser it should work but I used online pixi so if it will be update I don't sure it will be work.

Project is very simple and takes 8 hour.
